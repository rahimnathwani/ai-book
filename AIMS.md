I am writing a book for my colleague who is an experienced IT manager but who doesn't know a lot about creating applications with AI. I want to take him through a progression of realizations. For each one I want to give good examples of what something is and what it is not. The book should be aimed at someone who knows about IT and with some software engineering experience, and who has used ChatGPT but only at the level of a typical user who uses it a bit like Google, and for simple email editing tasks.
